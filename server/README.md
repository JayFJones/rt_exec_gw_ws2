# Node Exec Websocket Gateway

This is the server portion for the exec gateway. Rigth now it is a websocket only interface expecting the client to do the heavy lifting.  I can have another node instance act like a UI/Client/REST gateway to this one.

Future plans:
- Command white/black lists.
- timestamping
- proper websocket error handling
